# TCN-AE
Minimal working example of a (baseline) Temporal Convolutional Autoencoder (TCN-AE) for anomaly detection in time series, based on the paper:

Thill, Markus; Konen, Wolfgang; BÃ¤ck, Thomas (2020)
[Time Series Encodings with Temporal Convolutional Networks Inproceedings](http://www.gm.fh-koeln.de/ciopwebpub/Thill20a.d/bioma2020-tcn.pdf)
In: Vasile, Massimiliano; Filipic, Bogdan (Ed.): 9th International Conference on Bioinspired Optimisation Methods and Their Applications (BIOMA), Bruxelles.

This example was tested with the package versions specified in ```requirements.txt```. We use the excellent [keras-tcn](https://github.com/philipperemy/keras-tcn) package for our TCN blocks. 

More details regarding the Mackey-Glass Anomaly Benchmark (MGAB) and it's source code can be found in the [MGAB Repository](https://github.com/MarkusThill/MGAB).
